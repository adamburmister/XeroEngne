  <p class="lead">
    Your privacy is critically important to us. At <%= site_name %> we have a few fundamental principles:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for
      things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
    </li>
    <li>
      We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or
      protect our rights.
    </li>
    <li>
      We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our
      services.
    </li>
    <li>
      In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control your data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy
    available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license,
    which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace
    references to us with ones to you.)

  <p>
    If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our

  </p>

  <p>
    It is <%= site_name %> Inc.'s (“<strong><%= site_name %></strong>”) policy to respect your privacy regarding any
    information we may collect while operating our websites.
  </p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

  <p>
    Like most website operators, <%= site_name %> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
    browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and 
    the date and time of each visitor request. <%= site_name %>’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying 
    information is to better understand how <%= site_name %>’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 
    <%= site_name %> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report 
    on trends in the usage of its website.
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= site_name %> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
    for all site visitors through normal web server logging. <%= site_name %> only discloses logged in user IP addresses 
    under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
  </p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>
    Certain visitors to <%= site_name %>’s websites choose to interact with <%= site_name %> in ways that
    require <%= site_name %> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 
    <%= site_name %> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 
    <br>
    For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions 
    with <%= site_name %> – by purchasing account credit or subscriptions, for example – are asked to provide additional 
    information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. 
    <br>
    In each case, <%= site_name %> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the 
    purpose of the visitor’s interaction with <%= site_name %>.
    <br>
    <%= site_name %> does not disclose
    personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
    personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
    activities.
  </p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

  <p>
    <%= site_name %> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For example, this information
    may drive product feature development based on popularity.
    <br>
    <%= site_name %> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <%= site_name %> does
    not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
  </p>

  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>
    <%= site_name %> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
    of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process 
    it on <%= site_name %>’s behalf or to provide services available at <%= site_name %>’s websites, and (ii) that 
    have agreed not to disclose it to others. 
    <br>
    Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; 
    by using <%= site_name %>’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <%= site_name %>
    will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
    than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <%= site_name %> discloses
    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, 
    court order or other governmental request, or when <%= site_name %> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably 
    necessary to protect the property or rights of <%= site_name %>, third parties or the public at large. 
    <br>
    If you are a registered user of a <%= site_name %> website and have supplied your email address, <%= site_name %> 
    may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to 
    date with what’s going on with <%= site_name %> and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to 
    communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. 
    <br>
    If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
    we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
    other users.
    <br><%= site_name %> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
    alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
  </p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>

  <p>
    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
    provides to the website each time the visitor returns. <%= site_name %> uses cookies to help <%= site_name %>
    identify and track visitors, their usage of <%= site_name %> website, and their website access preferences. 
    <%= site_name %> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to 
    refuse cookies before using <%= site_name %>’swebsites, with the drawback that certain features of 
    <%= site_name %>’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
  </p>

  <h3>Business Transfers</h3>

  <p>
    If <%= site_name %>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that <%= site_name %> goes
    out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
    third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of <%= site_name %> may continue
    to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
  </p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

  <p>
    Although most changes are likely to be minor, <%= site_name %> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and
    in <%= site_name %>’s sole discretion. <%= site_name %> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
    changes to its Privacy Policy. 
    Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
